===================
Summary and Wrap-Up
===================

In this tutorial, we explained `ERC 792 <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/792>`_ and `ERC 1497 <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1497>`_ standards, implemented arbitrable and arbitrator contracts following the standards and built a simple React application with ``SimpleEscrowWithERC1497`` we developed in the tutorials.

All the contracts we developed in this documentation can be found under `the contracts <https://github.com/kleros/erc-792/tree/master/contracts>`_ directory and the source code of the React application resides under `the src <https://github.com/kleros/erc-792/tree/master/src>`_ directory.
